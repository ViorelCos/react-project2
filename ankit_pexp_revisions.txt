Revisions for NTtD Workflow visualization

1. For the P1_ popcodes, add the details of the popcode to the hover data for the node
2. Add hover data for C_ popcode graph nodes
3. Add workflow metadata to hover data for workflow step graph nodes
4. If the selected popcode is a child popcode (test name starts with 'C_'), 
   then use the getContainerPopcode method to retrieve the parent (P1_) popcode,
   and then show the visualization for the P1_ popcode.
